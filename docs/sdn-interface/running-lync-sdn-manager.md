# Running Lync SDN Manager

**Applies to**: Lync 2010 | Lync 2013 | Lync Server 2010 | Lync Server 2013

This section describes how to run Lync SDN Manager as a Windows service and as a console application.

The LSM Setup Wizards will install, configure, and start Lync SDN Manager service. This service is configured by default with the automatic startup type. However, you can restart it after the configuration is changed or if the service failed.

You can use the Windows Services to determine whether the service is running and, if not, reconfigure and start it. The Windows Services panel also let you change the credentials that are used to run the service.

In general, you run the Lync SDN Manager as a Windows service. In some cases, especially for debugging, you may want to run the LSM as a console application.
