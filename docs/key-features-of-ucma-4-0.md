# Key features of UCMA 4.0


_**Applies to:** Lync 2013 | Lync Server 2013_

**In this article**  
Modality-extensible communication framework  
Offline conference scheduling and management  
Presence publishing and presence subscription  
Contacts and groups  

Developers can use the key features listed in this topic to create multimodal and multiparty communication and collaboration applications with Enhanced Presence capabilities.

## Modality-extensible communication framework

  - Integrated support for instant messaging (IM).

  - Integrated support for audio, with Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP), early media, and multiple codec selection.

  - Common telephony features enabled by means of a reusable signaling framework (transfers, forwards, caller on hold, gateway interoperability and other operations).

  - Integrated audio devices: recorder, player, tone controller for Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) and Fax tones, and connectors for speech recognition and speech synthesis.

  - Loose coupling between signaling and media, allowing back-to-back and scenarios such as media-enabled Web clients.

  - User impersonation.

  - Conferencing features (control and monitoring): anonymous user join, trusted user join.

  - Multimodal escalation-to-conference helpers for instant messaging calls.
    
    Developers who implement a custom audio provider can provide support for escalation-to-conferencing for the custom media type.

  - Platform extensibility by means of the factory-based [Call](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh384235\(v=office.15\)) and [MediaProvider](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh383767\(v=office.15\)) classes.
    
    Developers can extend the Microsoft Unified Communications Managed API 4.0 SDK platform to handle a new media type by creating custom **Call**, **MediaProvider**, and [MediaFlow](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh366262\(v=office.15\)) subclasses that work with the new media type.

## Offline conference scheduling and management

  - Conference retrieval from PSTN conference ID.

## Presence publishing and presence subscription

  - Publishing framework based on presence manifest. The manifest is predefined in UCMA 4.0 and follows the same rules for presence publication as Microsoft Lync 2013.

  - Automatic user endpoint bootstrapping based on container manifest.

## Contacts and groups

The following features apply only to [UserEndpoint](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh348819\(v=office.15\)) type, not the [ApplicationEndpoint](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh384825\(v=office.15\)) type:

  - Contact object registration

  - Contact list creation and management

  - Contact organizations in provided or custom groups
