# Registering custom category names


**Applies to:** Lync 2013 | Lync Server 2013

To add a new category you must register the category name with Microsoft Lync Server 2013. To register a category name, call the following SQL commands from the command-line OSQL tool that can access the SQL database that is used by Lync Server 2013.

``` sql
  use rtc
  exec RtcRegisterCategoryDef N'aCategoryName'
```

rtc refers to the SQL database name, RtcRegisterCategoryDef is the name of a stored procedure, and aCategoryName is the name of the category to be registered. To run the commands, you must be a Lync Server 2013 administrator.
