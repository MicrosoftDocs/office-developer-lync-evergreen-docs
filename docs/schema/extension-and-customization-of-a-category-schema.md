# Extension and customization of a category schema

Learn how to extend and customize enhanced presence categories by using Microsoft Unified Communications Managed API 4.0.


**Applies to:** Lync 2013 | Lync Server 2013

Thanks to the XML representation, enhanced presence categories are extensible. They can be extended in the following ways:

  - An application developer can define a custom enhanced presence category to support application-specific presence features.

  - A category schema designer can extend an existing enhanced presence category to maintain version-related updates.

  - An application developer can extend an existing enhanced presence category to add custom presence features.

Enhanced presence extension and customization is available only to applications using UCMA 4.0.

## In this section

    Explain how version-related updates of an existing category schema are enabled using the [delimiter element](delimiter-element.md) and [end element](end-element.md) elements.

  - [Application extension of Enhanced Presence categories](application-extension-of-enhanced-presence-categories.md)  
    Explain how application-specific presence features may be added to an existing category schema using the [extension element](extension-element.md) element.
