# Preparing to receive presence publications


**Applies to:** Lync 2013 | Lync Server 2013

Your application can receive presence publications by other users by using a persistent or polling subscription. It can also receive the publications by submitting a query with the specified category names and presentities. Before your application can receive any presence publications, the user must sign in to the underlying Microsoft Lync Server 2013 instance. For more information, see [Signing in to Lync Server](signing-in-to-lync-server.md).

In Microsoft Unified Communications Managed API 4.0, a subscription, either persistent or polling, is managed by using a RemotePresenceView object. A query is handled by using a LocalEndpointPresenceServices object. Together, they support the following operations:

  - Start and stop a persistent subscription.

  - Start and stop a polling subscription.

  - Refresh all active subscriptions.

  - Submit a query.

The operations are asynchronous and the client must also implement the required event handlers. To prepare and receive presence publications, complete the following tasks:

  - Obtain the RemotePresenceView and LocalEndpointPresenceServices objects.

  - Register for events to be raised by the RemotePresenceView and LocalEndpointPresenceServices objects.

  - Implement the required event handlers to receive event notifications.

For more information about event implementation, see [Handling events to receive presence publications](handling-events-to-receive-presence-publications.md).

The following code example shows how to prepare for remote presence subscriptions and queries. The example is an excerpt of the C\# **UcmaPresenceWatcher** class that is used to include the other programming aspects of presence subscription and query that appear in this section.

    ///   4. Refreshing remote presence views
    ///
