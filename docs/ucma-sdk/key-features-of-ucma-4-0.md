# Key features of UCMA 4.0


**Applies to:** Lync 2013 | Lync Server 2013

 

Developers can use the key features listed in this topic to create multimodal and multiparty communication and collaboration applications with Enhanced Presence capabilities.

## Modality-extensible communication framework

  - Integrated support for instant messaging (IM).

  - Integrated support for audio, with Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP), early media, and multiple codec selection.

  - Common telephony features enabled by means of a reusable signaling framework (transfers, forwards, caller on hold, gateway interoperability and other operations).

  - Integrated audio devices: recorder, player, tone controller for Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) and Fax tones, and connectors for speech recognition and speech synthesis.

  - Loose coupling between signaling and media, allowing back-to-back and scenarios such as media-enabled Web clients.

  - User impersonation.

  - Conferencing features (control and monitoring): anonymous user join, trusted user join.

  - Multimodal escalation-to-conference helpers for instant messaging calls.
    
    Developers who implement a custom audio provider can provide support for escalation-to-conferencing for the custom media type.

  - Platform extensibility by means of the factory-based [Call](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh384235\(v=office.15\)) and [MediaProvider](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh383767\(v=office.15\)) classes.
    
    Developers can extend the Microsoft Unified Communications Managed API 4.0 SDK platform to handle a new media type by creating custom **Call**, **MediaProvider**, and [MediaFlow](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh366262\(v=office.15\)) subclasses that work with the new media type.

## Offline conference scheduling and management

  - Conference retrieval from PSTN conference ID.

## Presence publishing and presence subscription

  - Publishing framework based on presence manifest. The manifest is predefined in UCMA 4.0 and follows the same rules for presence publication as Microsoft Lync 2013.

  - Automatic user endpoint bootstrapping based on container manifest.

## Contacts and groups

The following features apply only to [UserEndpoint](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh348819\(v=office.15\)) type, not the [ApplicationEndpoint](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh384825\(v=office.15\)) type:

  - Contact object registration

  - Contact list creation and management

  - Contact organizations in provided or custom groups
