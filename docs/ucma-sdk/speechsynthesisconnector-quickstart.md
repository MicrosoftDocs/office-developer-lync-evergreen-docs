# SpeechSynthesisConnector (QuickStart)


**Applies to:** Lync 2013 | Lync Server 2013



Sample name: BasicCallHandling

Sample location: %ProgramFiles%\\Microsoft UCMA 4.0\\SDK\\Core\\Sample Applications\\QuickStarts\\AudioVideoCall\\

## Description

The application initializes the platform to start listening on behalf of a user, accepts the first incoming instant messaging call, and then ends the call. The application then tears down the call, conversation, and platform. The application prints log results to the console, and then exits, performing normal platform shutdown.
