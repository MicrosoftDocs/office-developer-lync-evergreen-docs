# Player


**Applies to:** Lync 2013 | Lync Server 2013

 

The [Player](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh349780\(v=office.15\)) class represents an entity that is capable of playing media to one or more media flows, and as such, provides a simple, scalable way to play an audio segment in a Windows Media Audio (WMA) file to multiple listeners. A **Player** instance renders the media that is represented by an instance of a subclass of the [MediaSource](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh348635\(v=office.15\)) abstract base class. The output from a **Player** instance goes to one or more [AudioVideoFlow](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh383533\(v=office.15\)) instances.

A **Player** acts as a pointer to a **MediaSource** object, and determines the current position to play in the media.

## Modes of operation

The **Player** class has two modes of operation:

  - **Automatic** (the default)
    
    In **Automatic** mode, the behavior of a **Player** instance depends on the state of the attached **AudioVideoFlow** instance. If an application calls the **Start** method on the **Player** instance, the **State** property on the **Player** instance changes to **Started**, but nothing is played until there is an active **AudioVideoFlow** instance attached to the **Player** instance (that is, until the **State** property on the **AudioVideoFlow** instance is **Active**).
    
    If the last active **AudioVideoFlow** instance is detached or terminated while a **Player** instance in **Automatic** mode is playing, the **Player** instance stops automatically.

  - **Manual**
    
    In **Manual** mode, a **Player** instance can operate with or without an attached **AudioVideoFlow** instance, although no one would be able to listen to the file being played if there were no attached **AudioVideoFlow** instance. If the last active **AudioVideoFlow** instance is detached or terminated while a **Player** instance in **Manual** mode is playing, the **Player** instance continues playing. In this regard, a **Player** instance in **Manual** mode behaves like a CD player whose speakers are disconnected.

## Playback speed

The [PlaybackSpeed](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh161922\(v=office.15\)) property on the **Player** class provides the capability to play back a WMA file at a different speed. This property gets or sets the rate at which the **Player** renders audio. An application can use **PlaybackSpeed** to develop an interface that gives the user more control in consuming the content. A message can be played back faster or slower depending on the **PlaybackSpeed** specified by the application.

The values in the **PlaybackSpeed** enumeration are **Half**, **ThreeQuarters**, **Normal**, **OneAndAQuarter**, **OneAndAHalf**, **OneAndThreeQuarters**, and **TwoTimes**. The values represent the multiple of normal playback speed. For example, **ThreeQuarters** represents 75% of normal playback speed.

## Player arrangements

The simplest arrangement is a single **Player** instance with a single attached **AudioVideoFlow** instance, as shown in the following illustration.

Single player, single AudioVideoFlow instance

  
![Single Player, single AudioVideoFlow instance](images/Dn466037.OnePlayerOneFlow(Office.15).jpg "Single Player, single AudioVideoFlow instance")

Another arrangement is to have a single **Player** instance that has multiple **AudioVideoFlow** instances, as shown in the following illustration. In this arrangement, the audio media to be played has a single play position and all attached **AudioVideoFlow** instances receive exactly the same audio simultaneously. This capability is useful for providing Music on Hold, or for broadcasting audio to multiple listeners.

Single Player, multiple AudioVideoFlow instances

A third arrangement is to have multiple **Player** instances with multiple attached **AudioVideoFlow** instances, as shown in the following illustration. Each **Player** instance determines a different playing point in the media source. The AudioVideoFlow instances attached to a given Player instance (for example, AudioVideoFlow 1 and AudioVideoFlow 2 that are attached to Player 1) receive the same audio at the same time, but AudioVideoFlow instances attached to different Player instances receive different audio segments at any given time (for example, AudioVideoFlow 1 and AudioVideoFlow 3 that are attached, respectively, to Player 1 and Player 2). This capablity is useful for providing Welcome messages to listeners when they arrive at a conference.

Multiple Player instances, multiple AudioVideoFlow instances

The **Player** class is scalable. In buffered mode, the **MediaSource** caches encoded versions of media. Given a [WmaFileSource](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh381280\(v=office.15\)) object, an application can play audio that was previously cached (**MediaSourceOpenMode.Buffered**) or from a file on demand in unbuffered mode (**MediaSourceOpenMode.Unbuffered**). When buffered mode is used, playing the cached stream provides significant performance gains.

## Example – using a player

The following code example shows the steps involved in using a [Player](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh349780\(v=office.15\)).

The essential points of creating and using a **Player** instance are shown in the following steps. Each step is associated with a line of code that is preceded by a comment with a number in it.

1.  Create a **Player** instance, using the constructor for this class.

2.  Attach the flow to the player, using the [AttachFlow](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh365942\(v=office.15\)) method on the **Player** class.

3.  Register for the player’s **StateChanged** event.

4.  Load the file that is to be played into memory by creating a [WmaFileSource](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh381280\(v=office.15\)) instance. The string parameter is the name of the WMA file to be played.

5.  Prepare the source file, using the [BeginPrepareSource](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh349115\(v=office.15\)) method on the **WmaFileSource** instance. The caller can specify whether the file is to be opened in **Buffered** mode or in **Unbuffered** mode. In the example code, the argument to [EndPrepareSource](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh382429\(v=office.15\)) is the return value from **BeginPrepareSource**.

6.  Set the player’s mode, using the [SetMode](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh382589\(v=office.15\)) method. In the example, the mode is set to **Manual**, which means that the player will begin playing only when the **State** of the attached **AutoVideoFlow** instance is **Active**. The Player stops when it reaches the end of the file or when there are no attached **AudioVideoFlow** instances that are **Active**. If the mode were set to **Manual**, the player would start playing immediately.

7.  Inform the player about the source of the media it will play, using the **SetSource** method.

8.  Start the player, using the player’s [Start](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh382632\(v=office.15\)) method.

9.  Pause the player, using the player’s [Pause](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh381641\(v=office.15\)) method. This step is shown only to demonstrate how to pause the player.

10. Restart the player after it was paused, using the **Start** method.

11. Stop the player, using the player’s [Stop](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh350156\(v=office.15\)) method.

12. Close the source, using the [Close](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh384406\(v=office.15\)) method on the **WmaFileSource** instance. An application must close the source when it's no longer needed. A source that is not closed can result in a memory leak.

13. Detach the flow, using the player’s [DetachFlow](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh383520\(v=office.15\)) method.
