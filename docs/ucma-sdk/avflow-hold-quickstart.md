# AVFlow-Hold (QuickStart)


**Applies to:** Lync 2013 | Lync Server 2013

 

Sample name: AVFlow-Hold

Sample location: %ProgramFiles%\\Microsoft UCMA 4.0\\SDK\\Core\\Sample Applications\\QuickStarts\\AudioVideoCall\\AVFlow-Hold

Place a call, put the call on hold, and then retrieve the call from hold.

## Description

The application places an audio/video call to the designated target, after initializing platform and endpoints.

After the call is connected, the application places the active **AudioVideoFlow** on hold. A moment later, the application retrieves the call from hold. The application prints the step-by-step actions it performs to the console, and then exits, performing normal platform shutdown.
