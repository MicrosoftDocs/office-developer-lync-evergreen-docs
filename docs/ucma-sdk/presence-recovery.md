# Presence recovery


**Applies to:** Lync 2013 | Lync Server 2013

The presence-related services of an endpoint—the [LocalOwnerPresence](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh348476\(v=office.15\)), [ContactGroupServices](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh383122\(v=office.15\)), and [PresenceServices](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh384331\(v=office.15\)) properties—are references to, respectively, the [LocalOwnerPresence](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh382370\(v=office.15\)), [ContactGroupServices](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh381099\(v=office.15\)), and [LocalEndpointPresenceServices](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh350157\(v=office.15\)) classes. These services use several Lync Server 2013 servers to publish and subscribe to presence data. For example, the User Services role of Lync Server 2013 is the repository of presence data, while the Front End service is responsible for routing publication and subscription requests. When any of the relevant Lync Server 2013 services goes offline or loses connectivity, the UCMA 4.0 presence services are disrupted as well.

The UCMA 4.0 platform is able to detect several types of disruption, such as when a **LocalOwnerPresence** instance is unable to subscribe to its self presence, or when a **RemotePresenceView** instance is unable to add a new target. For registered endpoints UCMA receives a notification from the Lync Server 2013 server that **User Services** is unavailable. When UCMA learns of a disruption, the state of the affected service changes to **WaitingForRetry**. This causes UCMA 4.0 to retry the failed operation to recover from a temporary server failure.
