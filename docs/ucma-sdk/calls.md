# Calls


_**Applies to:** Lync 2013 | Lync Server 2013_

A call is a communication session between two endpoints: a local endpoint and a remote endpoint. UCMA 4.0 represents the call concept by the [Call](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh384235\(v=office.15\)) abstract class, and provides non-abstract classes that implement three specific types of calls:

  - [InstantMessagingCall](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh161841\(v=office.15\)) class.
    
    An **InstantMessagingCall** instance is used in a communication session for which the media type is Message, or text.

  - [AudioVideoCall](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh383901\(v=office.15\)) class.
    
    An **AudioVideoCall** instance is used in a communication session for which the media type is Audio.
    

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > <P>The default media provider for the <STRONG>AudioVideoCall</STRONG> class does not support the Video media type.</P>



  - [BackToBackCall](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh365598\(v=office.15\)) class.
    
    A **BackToBackCall** instance represents a logical SIP network element that mediates SIP signaling between two call legs. A **BackToBackCall** instance can be used to connect two clients that send and receive audio alone or audio and video.

This section describes common operations that a UCMA-based application performs on calls.
