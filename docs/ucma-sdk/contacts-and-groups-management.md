# Contacts and groups management


**Applies to:** Lync 2013 | Lync Server 2013

A contact is a unified communication entity that is identified by a SIP URI. One or more contacts can be assembled into logical collections called groups. When a group is created, it's assigned a group ID, which is a server-assigned integer. The Contacts and Groups API in Microsoft Unified Communications Managed API 4.0 is available only for [UserEndpoint](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh348819\(v=office.15\)) objects.

For more information, see [ContactGroupServices](contactgroupservices.md).
