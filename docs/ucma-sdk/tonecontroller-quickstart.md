Running the sample  

Sample name: ToneController

Sample location: %ProgramFiles%\\Microsoft UCMA 4.0\\SDK\\Core\\Sample Applications\\QuickStarts\\AudioVideoCall\\ToneController

## Description

The application places an audio/video call to the designated target, after initializing platform and endpoints. After the call is connected, the application waits for the **AudioVideoFlow** to become active (when the value of its **State** property is **Active**), and then attaches a **ToneController** and registers a handler for an event that is raised when a DTMF tones or Fax tones are received. For each tone that is received, the application replies by sending the same tone back to the remote endpoint. Zero and a fax tone will shut down the platform and close the demo.

  - Platform an endpoint initialization

  - **AudioVideoFlow** handling and control.
