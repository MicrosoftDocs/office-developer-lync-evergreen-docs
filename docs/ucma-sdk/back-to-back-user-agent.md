# Back-to-back user agent


**Applies to:** Lync 2013 | Lync Server 2013

Microsoft Unified Communications Managed API 4.0 provides several classes to support the back-to-back user agent concept. The principal class of interest to application developers is the [BackToBackCall](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh365598\(v=office.15\)) class. Using back-to-back user agent functionality, an application can perform the following operations:

  - Create a **BackToBackCall** instance, which establishes back-to-back connectivity between two calls. For example, a customer and an agent are connected through a back-end call center.

  - Perform midway call control (transfer calls, park calls, play music to customers on hold) on an established back-to-back call.
