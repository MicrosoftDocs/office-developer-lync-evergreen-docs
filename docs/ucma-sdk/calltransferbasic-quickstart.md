# CallTransferBasic (QuickStart)


**Applies to:** Lync 2013 | Lync Server 2013

 

Sample name: CallTransferBasic

Sample location: %ProgramFiles%\\Microsoft UCMA 4.0\\SDK\\Core\\Sample Applications\\QuickStarts\\CallTransferBasic

## Description

This sample involves communication between three users: a transferor, a transferee, and a transfer target. The sample logs in as the transferor, who is the user who receives an incoming audio-video call from the transferee, logged in to Microsoft Lync 2013.The transferor accepts the call from the transferee, and initiates a transfer to the transfer target. This sample demonstrates the ATTENDED transfer-type; hence after the transfer completes, the initial incoming call is disconnected.

The user can choose between attended or unattended transfers by changing the transfer-type in the code.

The difference between attended and unattended transfer is that unattended transfers begin the transfer (send the REFER to the caller) and terminate the initial call on receipt of the transfer request response (202-Reply) from the caller. Attended transfers, on the other hand, wait to terminate the call until the transfer either succeeds or fails. The application prints logging to the console, and then quits, shutting down the platform normally.

## Features
