# SubscribePresenceView (QuickStart)


**Applies to:** Lync 2013 | Lync Server 2013

 

Sample name: SubscribePresenceView

Sample location: %ProgramFiles%\\Microsoft UCMA 4.0\\SDK\\Core\\Sample Applications\\QuickStarts\\SubscribePresenceView

## Description

The application initializes the platform and endpoint and subscribes to a target user. The application uses two [RemotePresenceView](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh381152\(v=office.15\)) objects, each configured with different [RemotePresenceViewSubscriptionMode](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh381952\(v=office.15\)) values: **Persistent** and **Polling**.

After the subscription is complete, the application listens for incoming notifications from a user logged in to Microsoft Lync 2013 and displays the notifications in the console.
