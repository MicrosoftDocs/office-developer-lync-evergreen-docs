# VoiceXML browser


**Applies to:** Lync 2013 | Lync Server 2013

The [Browser](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg452712\(v=office.15\)) class in Microsoft Unified Communications Managed API 4.0 is derived from the **Browser** class in the **Microsoft.Speech.VoiceXml** namespace. [Browser](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg452712\(v=office.15\)) has access to all the public members of the **Browser** class in the **Microsoft.Speech.VoiceXml** namespace, as well as all the enumerated types, EventArgs classes, and interpretation result classes of the **Microsoft.Speech.VoiceXml.Common** namespace.

A **Browser** connects to the call processing and audio resources in UCMA 4.0 through the **SetAudioVideoCall()** method. See [Connecting to audio resources in UCMA 4.0](connecting-to-audio-resources-in-ucma-4-0.md) for more information.

### Browser functionality in UCMA 4.0

The **Browser** is the means by which callers communicate with a VoiceXML application in UCMA 4.0. A hosting .NET application binds an incoming phone call with an instance of the **Browser**, which loads a VoiceXML start page. The **Browser** processes the elements on a VoiceXML page and provides the connection to the call processing and audio resources in UCMA 4.0 that give information to, and collect information from, a caller.

In a VoiceXML session, a **Browser** instance may perform any of the following operations, as instructed by the VoiceXML application:

  - Transfer a call to a recipient.

  - Collect information from a caller through speech or Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) recognition.

  - Give information to a caller using synthesized speech or recorded audio.

  - Record audio spoken by a caller.

  - Retrieve data from a web server using HTTP GET commands.

  - Send information received during the call to a web server using HTTP POST commands.

  - Log information about the session.

  - Generate events with information about the session.

  - Exit the VoiceXML page and end the session.
