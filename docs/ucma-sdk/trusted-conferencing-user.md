# Trusted conferencing user


**Applies to:** Lync 2013 | Lync Server 2013

The trusted conferencing user (TCU) feature makes it easier to develop applications with conferencing "bots" that provide services to other users in a conference. Trusted users are considered presenters by default and appear hidden to users in the roster.
