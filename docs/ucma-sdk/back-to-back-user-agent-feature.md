# Back-to-back user agent (feature)


**Applies to:** Lync 2013 | Lync Server 2013

The back-to-back user agent concept is essential for call center/helpdesk applications. The back-to-back user agent acts as a bridge between an incoming customer call and one or more call center agents. The most important features of this concept, as implemented in UCMA 4.0 are the following:

  - Agents are anonymous.
    
    The customer communicates directly with the back-to-back user agent, not the call center agent, enabling the agent’s identity to be hidden from the caller.

  - The pairing between callers and agents is many-to-many.
    
    One customer can be served by multiple agents, or multiple customers can be served by a single agent.

  - A supervisor can monitor a conversation between a customer and an agent, and can "whisper" advice to the agent that is inaudible to the customer.
    
    Monitoring the conversation aids in quality control.
