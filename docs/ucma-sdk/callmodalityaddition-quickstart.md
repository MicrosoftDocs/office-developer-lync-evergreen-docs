# CallModalityAddition (QuickStart)


**Applies to:** Lync 2013 | Lync Server 2013

  

Sample name: CallModalityAddition

Sample location: %ProgramFiles%\\Microsoft UCMA 4.0\\SDK\\Core\\Sample Applications\\QuickStarts\\CallModalityAddition

## Description

The application initializes the platform to log in a pair of users and initiates an instant messaging call between them. After the instant messaging call is established, the application reuses the existing conversation to send an audio-video call between the two users as part of the same dialog. After the audio-video call is established, the application prints logging to the console, and then quits, shutting down the platform normally. Note that no audio-video media or instant messages are actually exchanged between the users.
