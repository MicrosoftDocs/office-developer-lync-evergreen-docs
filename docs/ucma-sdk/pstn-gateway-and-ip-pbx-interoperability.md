# PSTN gateway and IP-PBX interoperability


**Applies to:** Lync 2013 | Lync Server 2013

For IP-based real-time applications that must communicate with a PSTN network on one side and a unified communications network on the other side, Microsoft Unified Communications Managed API 4.0 provides an application the ability to interoperate with SIP PSTN gateways and IP-PBXs with the unified communications network.

The following SIP peers can connect to the UCMA application:

1.  SIP gateways.

2.  SIP-enabled IP-PBXs that support the following phones.
    
    1.  SIP phones
    
    2.  Soft phones that support SIP

SIP peers should support the following protocols:

  - SIP—RFC 3261

  - DTMF—RFC4733

  - SDP—RFC 3264

In addition, SIP peers:

  - Must provide media session parameter negotiation (endpoint, codec, and, if applicable, encryption parameters) through SDP, as defined in the SIP and related RFCs and used in SIP.

  - Must provide media/audio transport using RTP/RTCP over UDP.

  - Must meet the Supported IP Gateways requirements listed in [Telephony Advisor for Exchange 2010](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/ee364753.aspx).

The following illustration shows a typical setup.
