The application initializes a platform and two endpoints, each on behalf of a different user. The endpoints establish a peer-to-peer instant messaging call between themselves. One of the endpoints escalates the instant messaging call into a conference.

After the last of the command and control activities complete, the application quits, shutting down the platform normally.
