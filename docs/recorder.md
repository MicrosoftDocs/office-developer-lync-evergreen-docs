# Recorder


_**Applies to:** Lync 2013 | Lync Server 2013_

A [Recorder](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh381624\(v=office.15\)) is an entity that can receive audio media that comes from an [AudioVideoFlow](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh383533\(v=office.15\)) instance and record it to a file. Depending on the state of the attached **AudioVideoFlow** instance, a **Recorder** can automatically start or stop.

Unlike the [Player](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh349780\(v=office.15\)) class, which has two modes of operation, the **Recorder** class can be thought of as having only one mode of operation, which is similar to **Automatic** mode in the **Player** class. If an application calls the [Start](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh383534\(v=office.15\)) method on a **Recorder** instance, nothing will be recorded until an active **AudioVideoFlow** instance is attached to it. In addition, if there is no active **AudioVideoFlow** instance attached to a **Recorder** instance, or if the **AudioVideoFlow** instance is detached or terminated, the **Recorder** instance stops automatically.

If a **Recorder** instance has started recording a file, an application can cause recording to stop by calling the [Stop](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh381306\(v=office.15\)) method. In addition, state changes in the attached **AudioVideoFlow** instance can also cause the **Recorder** instance to stop. For example, if the **State** property on the **AudioVideoFlow** instance changes from **Active** to **Terminated**, the **Recorder** instance stops. Non-state configuration changes in the **AudioVideoFlow** instance, such as Hold, Retrieve, Mute, and changing the media channel direction, do not stop the **Recorder** instance. For example, if a call that is being recorded remains on hold for five minutes, the **Recorder** instance records five minutes of silence.

A **Recorder** will not record to a file with the hidden attribute.

> <P>Files recorded by a <STRONG>Recorder</STRONG> device do not support Digital Rights Management (DRM). This means that conversations recorded by a <STRONG>Recorder</STRONG> device can be played by any player that supports the Windows Media Audio (WMA) media format, potentially exposing personal or confidential information.</P>



## Example – Using a recorder

The following code example shows the steps involved in using a [Recorder](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh381624\(v=office.15\)).


> [!WARNING]
> <P>This code example is not a complete example. Several methods, properties, and events are used in this example, but are not defined within the example.</P>



The essential points of creating and using a **Recorder** instance appear in the following steps. Each step is associated with a line of code that is preceded by a comment with a number in it.

1.  Create a **Recorder** instance, using the constructor for this class.

2.  Attach the flow to the recorder, using the [AttachFlow](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh381868\(v=office.15\)) method on the **Recorder** class.

3.  Create the object that receives the recording, using the [WmaFileSink](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh382490\(v=office.15\)) constructor. The parameter to this constructor is a string that contains the name of the WMA file that will be created. As previously mentioned, the file should not be a hidden file.

4.  Register for the **StateChanged** event.

5.  Call the recorder’s [SetSink](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh348664\(v=office.15\)) method, which informs the recorder of where the recorded data should go.

6.  Start the recorder, using the [Start](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh383534\(v=office.15\)) method on the **Recorder** instance.

7.  Pause the recorder, using the [Pause](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh349541\(v=office.15\)) method on the **Recorder** instance.

8.  Stop the recorder, using the [Stop](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh381306\(v=office.15\)) method on the **Recorder** instance.

9.  Detach the flow from the **Recorder** instance, using the [DetachFlow](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh385116\(v=office.15\)) method.
