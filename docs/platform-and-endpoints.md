# Platform and endpoints


_**Applies to:** Lync 2013 | Lync Server 2013_

The [CollaborationPlatform](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh385176\(v=office.15\)) class provides connection management, message dispatching, and other services to endpoints. An application creates an instance of the **CollaborationPlatform** class to take advantage of the Microsoft Unified Communications Managed API 4.0 infrastructure. An application developer can use one of the constructors in this class to create a server platform, from which an application server can be created. Another constructor can be used to create an auto-provisioned application server platform, and a third constructor in this class can be used to create a client platform, on which a number of user endpoints can be created.

The following illustration shows the principal classes that represent the two platform types and the three endpoint types.
