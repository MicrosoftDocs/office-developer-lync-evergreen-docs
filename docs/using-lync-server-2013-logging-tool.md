# Using Lync Server 2013 Logging Tool


_**Applies to:** Lync 2013 | Lync Server 2013_

An important part of the process of developing a UCMA 4.0 application is the ability to trace the protocol stack. To do this, you will enable tracing. By viewing the contents of the protocol stack during or after the execution of your code, you can familiarize yourself with the topology of UCMA 4.0.

## Setting up a protocol trace

When you install the UCMA 4.0 SDK, the Lync Server 2013 Logging Tool (OCSLogger.exe) is located in the SDK\\Core\\Tracing folder in the UCMA 4.0 SDK installation directory. Launching OCSLogger.exe opens the window shown in the following figure. Before starting a trace, the user should do the following:

  - Select a trace provider.
    
    The default choices are **Collaboration**, **S4**, **SpeechComponent**, and **SpeechVxmlComponent**. You can start a trace for one or more of the listed components.

  - Specify a log file folder.
    
    When UCMA 4.0 SDK is installed it creates a Tracing folder under the %WinDir% directory. Lync Server 2013 Logging Tool writes log files to this directory. If you want log files written to a different direction, click the **Browse** button and select or create the folder in which log files are written.

  - **Define the tracing level.**
    
    By clicking the appropriate tracing **Level** radio button, the user can filter the kinds of messages that will be recorded in the log file. Checking the **Errors** radio button causes only error messages to be recorded to the log file. Each radio button below the **Errors** button causes more messages to be recorded to the log file.

### Account permissions

To start a protocol trace you must be a member of the Administrators group on the computer running the protocol trace.

### Viewing a protocol trace

You can have a trace running for each of the two trace provider components.

Lync Server 2013 Logging Tool produces .ETL files as its output. By default, these files are written to the %WINDIR%\\Tracing directory. The S4.etl file in this directory will contain error, warning, and protocol messages.

## Lync Server 2013 Logging Tool user interface

Lync Server 2013 Logging Tool displays a main dialog and four dialogs available through the **Advanced Options** menu item. These are discussed in detail in the following topics.

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


The remainder of the main dialog consists of panes for **Logging Options** and **Global Options**, as well as two text boxes that specify the paths to the log file folder and format file folder.

#### Logging options

The **Components** pane displays four components: **Collaboration**, **S4**, **SpeechComponent**, and **SpeechVxmlComponent**. Check one or more to enable logging the selected components.

The **Level** pane allows you to specify the types of messages that are recorded in the log file. The levels are arranged from most restrictive (**Fatal Errors**) at the top to least restrictive (**All**) at the bottom. The levels are cumulative, with each level including messages of that type, in addition to messages from all previous levels (that is, levels higher in the list of radio buttons). For example, clicking the **Warnings** level causes all warning messages to be logged, in addition to all error messages and fatal error messages.

The **Flags** pane enables you to set the types of messages that are logged. Any combination of the flags shown in the following table can be chosen.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Some flags are not available for all components. The following table describes the flags and lists any component limitations.</P>



<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><p>Flag</p></th>
<th><p>Description</p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>TF_COMPONENT</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Log miscellaneous messages not covered by the other trace flag categories.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p><strong>TF_PROTOCOL</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Log protocol messages or data—SIP or CCCP messages. Other components can also log their text-based messages.</p>
<p>Not available for the <strong>SpeechComponent</strong> and <strong>SpeechVxmlComponent</strong> components.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>TF_CONNECTION</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Log connection-related errors or warnings. Information on connections established to and from a particular component, etc. This can also include significant network-level information for components that do not have the concept of a &quot;connection.&quot;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Not available for the <strong>S4</strong>, <strong>SpeechComponent</strong>, and <strong>SpeechVxmlComponent</strong> components.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p><strong>TF_DIAG</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Log diagnostics events that can be used to diagnose or troubleshoot the component. For example, for SipStack, these include certificate failures or errors, or DNS warnings or errors.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Not available for the <strong>S4</strong> and <strong>SpeechVxmlComponent</strong> components.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>All Flags</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Log messages in all categories.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


#### Global options

The **Log File Options** pane contains the **Type** pane and the **Maximum Size** text box, which determine how new log records are inserted into the log file and its size. Choose **Circular** to indicate that when a log file reaches its maximum size, new records are to be placed at the beginning. Choose **Sequential** to indicate that new records should be placed at the end of the log file. Choose **New File** to start a new log file.

The **Real Time Options** pane contains a check box for **Enabled**. If **Enabled** is checked, a check box for **Display only** can be selected.

The **Filter Options** pane enables a user to restrict logging to specified URIs or fully-qualified domain names (FQDN), each of which requires input validation. When filtering is used, the log files will contain information only from the URIs or FQDNs listed in the **URI** and **FQDN** text boxes. Filtering can be applied to two user URIs, or two machine FQDNs (or IP addresses), or one URI and one FQDN. Click **Clear Filters** to clear the contents of the **URI** and **FQDN** text boxes.

The **Log File Folder** text box specifies the folder in which to write log files. By default this is %WinDir%\\Tracing\\.

### Advanced Options dialog—Formatting tab

The **Formatting** tab of the **Advanced Options** dialog box enables the user to determine the information that appears in log records, and how the information is formatted.

The **Log File Prefix** text box is used for formatting events that are written to log files. The **Real Time Prefix** text box is used for formatting events to the real-time tracing window.

The **Display times in UTC** check box determines whether times in log records are displayed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) (checked), or system time (unchecked).

The **Format file search path** text box specifies a semicolon-separated list of folder paths. OCSLogger searches for .TMF files in these paths if it is unable to find format information for a log record in the default.tmx file that is included with OCSLogger. This functionality is used primarily to support patching that results in new format information for some components, where that information is not present in default.tmx.

![Lync Server Logging Tool - Formatting](images/Dn466134.OCSLogger_Options_Fmt(Office.15).jpg "Lync Server Logging Tool - Formatting")

The variables used in log file formatting are shown in the following table.

The numeric variables (%n) can be followed by a printf-style format specifier. For example, %3\!04X\! displays the thread ID as a four-digit hexadecimal number, %7\!08X\! displays the thread ID as an eight-digit hexadecimal number, and %9\!D\! displays the CPU number as an integer. The %2, %4, and %5 variables represent string quantities, so if a format specifier is used, it must be one pertaining to strings, such as \!s\!.
