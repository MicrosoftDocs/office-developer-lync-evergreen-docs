## Conversation participants

People who are participating in Lync 2013 are represented by [Microsoft.Lync.Model.Conversation.Participant](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/jj267311\(v=office.15\)) objects in a collection obtained by reading the [Conversation.Participants](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/jj293292\(v=office.15\)) property of a **Conversation**. A **Participant** object encapsulates the state of individuals in conversations. For example, the video stream pinned state for a user is exposed by the **Participant** object. Person-specific operations such as admitting or denying meeting access from a meeting lobby are done in the context of an individual **Participant** object. The **Participant** object exposes its own complete set of conversation modalities that encapsulate the IM, audio/video, or sharing interactions between individual conversation participants.

### Inviting participants to a conversation

You can invite a person to a conversation by getting his or her [Microsoft.Lync.Model.Contact](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/jj266463\(v=office.15\)) object or the [Microsoft.Lync.Model.ContactEndpoint](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/jj276722\(v=office.15\)) of a telephone number to be dialed. There is an overload of the **Conversation.AddParticipant** method that is appropriate for the kind of entity that you're adding to the conversation. **Participant** objects are created by the API platform when you call the [Conversation.AddParticipant](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/jj266479\(v=office.15\)) (Contact) method or the [Conversation.AddParticipant](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/jj266479\(v=office.15\)) (ContactEndpoint) method. After a person or telephone number is added to a conversation and the [Conversation.ParticipantAdded](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/jj275759\(v=office.15\)) event is raised, you invite the person by sending an initial IM on the conversation [Microsoft.Lync.Model.Conversation.InstantMessageModality](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/jj266036\(v=office.15\)) modality or dial the added telephone number by connecting the conversation [Microsoft.Lync.Model.Conversation.AudioVideo.AVModality](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/jj274580\(v=office.15\)).
