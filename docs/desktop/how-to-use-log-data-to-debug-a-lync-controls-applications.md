## Prerequisites

For a list of prerequisites, see [How to: Create a Silverlight page that displays a Lync presence control](how-to-create-a-silverlight-page-that-displays-a-lync-presence-control.md).

## Create a WPF application

Create a Lync WPF application with logging enabled and then add XAML code that contains an error.

### To create the application

1.  Create a Lync WPF application with logging enabled.
    
    For more information, see [How to: Add logging to a Lync Controls application](how-to-add-logging-to-a-lync-controls-application.md).

2.  In Page.xaml, add the following XAML, which sets the [Source](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh363511\(v=office.15\)) property to an invalid URI.
    
    ```xaml
    <controls:StartInstantMessagingButton Source="sip:typo@contoso"/>
    ```

3.  Exit Microsoft Lync 2013.

## Debug the Lync Is Not Running error

To experience how easy it is to use log data, find the message created after exiting Lync 2013.

### To set up and run the Lync Is Not Running scenario

1.  Exit Lync 2013.

2.  Build and run the application created in the previous procedure.
    
    In the log file, output that resembles the following message appears.
    
        2010-07-21T13:16:05.4663269-07:00 : Error : MThreadId=10 : Categories=LyncServiceProvider : Message=UCClientInitializationFailed:Microsoft Lync 4.0.7400.542 or later is not running and it is required for this application. Please start Lync to resolve this issue.

## Debug a malformed URI

Review the message created by a malformed URI after you exited Lync 2013 in the previous procedure.

### To run the Lync Is Not Running scenario

1.  The Lync 2013 session ended in the previous procedure. Restart Lync 2013.

2.  Build and run the application created in the first procedure.
    
    In the log file, output that resembles the following message appears.
    
        Unable to create IContactModel from ContactUri.  Uri='typo@contoso.'
        Unable to create a contact for 'sip:typo@contoso.'. System.ArgumentException: Value does not fall within the expected range.

3.  Fix the malformed URI: sip:typo@contoso.com.

4.  Build and run the application.
