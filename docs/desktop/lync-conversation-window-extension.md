## CWE overview

Microsoft Lync 2013 CWE is an embedded browser that allows display of a contextual application with a Lync 2013 conversation. CWE provides a hosting environment that supports traditional and rich Internet applications. To display a Microsoft Silverlight application in CWE, embed the application in an HTML page. For more information, see [How to: Create a Conversation Window Extension application in Lync SDK](how-to-create-a-conversation-window-extension-application-in-lync-sdk.md).

## Opening Conversation Window Extension

CWE opens programmatically in the following scenarios:

  - When a registered context package opens in a conversation. For more information, see [Register contextual conversation packages](register-contextual-conversation-packages.md).

  - Use the [BeginOpenExtensibilityWindow](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/jj293519\(v=office.15\)) method.

CWE can also be opened manually by selecting an application from the contact card **Options** menu. For more information, see [Add custom commands to Lync menus](add-custom-commands-to-lync-menus.md).

## Closing Conversation Window Extension

To close CWE, click the **Close** button on the tab at the bottom of the window or use the [CloseExtensibilityWindow](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/jj275301\(v=office.15\)) method to close the window programatically. Otherwise, CWE closes when the conversation window closes.

## Conversation Window Extension size

There are two ways to specify CWE dimensions:

  - Use the [ConversationWindowExtensionSize](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/jj278101\(v=office.15\)) enumeration.

  - During Install Registration, use the ExtensibilityWindowSize registry key for the CWE application. For more information, see [Register contextual conversation packages](register-contextual-conversation-packages.md).
