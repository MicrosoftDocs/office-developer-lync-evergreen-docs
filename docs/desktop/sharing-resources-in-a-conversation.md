# Sharing resources in a conversation

Learn about programmatically sharing a computer monitor, desktop, or running program with another Microsoft Lync 2013 user in a conversation window by using classes in Microsoft Lync 2013 SDK.

## Resource sharing overview

Microsoft Lync 2013 SDK lets you start system resource sharing and manage user control of a shared resource on the sharing stage of a Microsoft Lync 2013 conversation window. The only way for a user to see shared resources in a conversation is to open a Lync 2013 conversation window on the desktop. The Lync 2013 API does not provide a control that you can drop into your application UI. However, you can use the API to build programmatic control over the sharing stage of the conversation window.

The [Microsoft.Lync.Model.Conversation.Sharing](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/jj274504\(v=office.15\)) namespace contains the classes and enumerations that you use in resource sharing. Figure 1 shows a running process shared on the Lync 2013 sharing stage and visible to all conversation participants.

In general, you program by using the following kinds of Lync 2013 API objects:

  - Shareable resource objects such as a running process or desktop.

  - Sharing conversation modality objects.

  - Conversation participant objects.

Each of these objects expose methods, events, and properties that you use to manage the resource sharing process. Most of the code that you write for resource sharing handles events on the sharing modalities.

## Working with shareable resources

A shareable resource can be the local desktop, any display attached to the local workstation, or a running process such as Notepad.exe. Although a computer can have any number of shareable resources, only one of these resources can be shared in a conversation at a time. In addition, only one conversation participant can share a resource at a time. A shared resource that is under the control of the resource owner is not considered controlled. It is only when the control of the resource is given to another user that the resource is considered controlled. The shared conversation resource can be controlled by one user at a time. Resource control amounts to giving the controlling user access to the local mouse and keyboard in the context of the shared resource. For example, if a running process has a UI with a **Close** button, the controlling user can click the button with the controlled mouse and close the process.

### Maintaining a list of locally shareable resources

A locally shareable collection of resources includes the desktop, monitors, and any UI-based processes that are running when a conversation is started and the conversation application sharing modality is connected. You are not notified when new processes are started after the application sharing modality is connected. To refresh a shareable resource list, you must read the [ShareableResources](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/jj278380\(v=office.15\)) property.

## Working with sharing conversation modality objects

When a resource control action is available, the methods that you invoke to take an available action are exposed on the [ApplicationSharingModality](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/jj275536\(v=office.15\)) object. The conversation and each conversation participant own an application sharing modality. There are restrictions on which actions you can invoke on a given application sharing modality. Similarly, application sharing modality events are exposed on the conversation and participant application sharing modalities but not all modality events are raised on all of these modalities. In addition, not all application sharing modality operations are valid for all of the application sharing modality objects in a conversation.

This section tells you which modality events you should register for on which application sharing modality objects in the conversation and which operations are valid for each application sharing modality object.

This modality event handling code is invoked for the following kinds of modality state changes:

  - The availability of a resource control action is changed.

  - The user who controls a shared resource is changed.

  - A user is requesting control of a resource that is shared locally.

  - The locally shared resource is swapped for a different local shareable resource or a local resource is no longer shared.

  - The sharing modality connection state changes as a conversation starts or ends.

  - The local user shares, grants, or revokes control of a locally shared resource.

### Application sharing modality methods

The following tables show all of the methods that can be called on the [Microsoft.Lync.Model.Conversation.Sharing.ApplicationSharingModality](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/jj275536\(v=office.15\)) object. The first table shows methods that start resource sharing. The second and third tables show methods that are related to controlling a shared resource.

</tr>

</table>

The methods in the following table let you share resources. Control of locally shared resources can be managed by using the control-related application sharing methods.
