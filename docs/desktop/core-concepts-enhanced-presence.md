## Enhanced presence object model

Enhanced presence is the user-specific collection of information that describes the availability and willingness of a Lync 2013 user to join a conversation. The presence information includes the current availability of the user, the user’s current activity, the calendar state, working hours, a personal note from the user, and an out-of-office note if published by the user.
