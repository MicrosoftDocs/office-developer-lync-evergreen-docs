## Privacy relationship administration

A Lync privacy relationship is a set of five rules that govern how much of a user’s contact card information is visible to other users. The signed-in user does not need to apply one of these privacy relationship rules to the contact list users and other users who subscribe to the signed-in user’s presence. By default, the Colleague privacy relationship rule is applied to the users who belong to the same organization. The default privacy relationship for users outside of the organization is External Contacts.

Figure 1 shows a sample application that lets a user set the privacy relationships of all users in his or her contact list. The contact list is collapsed to the group level in figure 1. When the sample runs, a user expands a group, selects a contact and a privacy relationship rule, and clicks the **Set relationship** button. For information about implementing this feature in your application, see [How to: Administer privacy relationships between Lync users](how-to-administer-privacy-relationships-between-lync-users.md).
