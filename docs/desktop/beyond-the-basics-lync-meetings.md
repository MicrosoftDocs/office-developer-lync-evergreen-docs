## Advanced meeting management

To create a more secure online meeting environment for your organization, you must be able to define who can get access to a meeting and then provide access keys to the correct people. In an open meeting, a meeting organizer must be able to approve or decline meeting admittance as people enter the meeting lobby. A meeting organizer must be able to ensure that the video feed for the meeting presenter is shown on the client applications of all participants. Finally, meeting participants should be able to choose the video feeds of other participants to show in the video gallery in a meeting conversation window.

The topics in this section describe the programming concepts that make these features possible in your application.
