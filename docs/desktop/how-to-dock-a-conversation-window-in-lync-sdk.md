## Declare a hosting window

### To declare window controls

1.  Add a grid to the window and define three rows and three columns.
    
    ```xaml
            <Grid x:Uid="Grid_2">
                <Grid.RowDefinitions>
                    <RowDefinition x:Uid="RowDefinition_1" Height="Auto"/>
                    <RowDefinition x:Uid="RowDefinition_2" />
                    <RowDefinition x:Uid="RowDefinition_3" Height="50"/>
                </Grid.RowDefinitions>
                <Grid.ColumnDefinitions>
                    <ColumnDefinition Width="81"/>
                    <ColumnDefinition x:Uid="ColDefinition_2"/>
                    <ColumnDefinition x:Uid="ColDefinition_3" Width="80"/>
                </Grid.ColumnDefinitions>
    
            </Grid>
    ```

2.  Add a stack panel to the first grid row, second column.
    
    The stack panel declares a location for the IM button and a text block that displays the name of the invited user.
    
    ```xaml
                <StackPanel 
                    x:Uid="StackPanel_1" 
                    Grid.Row="0" 
                    Grid.Column="1"
                    Orientation="Horizontal" 
                    HorizontalAlignment="Center" Margin="0,0">
                </StackPanel>
    ```

3.  Add a [Microsoft.Lync.Controls.StartInstantMessagingButton](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh379340\(v=office.15\)) to the stack panel.
    
    <table>
    <colgroup>
    <col style="width: 100%" />
    </colgroup>
    <thead>
    <tr class="header">
    <th><img src="images/JJ933112.alert_note(Office.15).gif" title="Tip" alt="Tip" /><strong>Tip</strong></th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td><p>The <strong>StartInstantMessagingButtonSource()</strong> property must be set to the SIP address of a Lync user. You can set it declaratively in XAML or in code by setting the property to a selected contact URI property from a contact search result as in the following example.</p>
    <p>SearchResult result = (SearchResult) _ContactSearchResultList.SelectedItem;<br />
    _myStartIMButton.Source = result.Contact.Uri;</p>
    <p></p></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>
    
    ```xaml
                    <Controls:StartInstantMessagingButton 
                        x:Uid="_myStartIMButton" 
                        Grid.Row="0" 
                        x:Name="_myStartIMButton" 
                        />
    ```

4.  Add a text box in the stack panel that displays the name of the person to invite.
    
    <table>
    <colgroup>
    <col style="width: 100%" />
    </colgroup>
    <thead>
    <tr class="header">
    <th><img src="images/JJ933089.alert_caution(Office.15).gif" title="Important note" alt="Important note" /><strong>Important</strong></th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td><p>The text block is bound to the <strong>StartInstantMessagingButtonDisplayName()</strong> property.</p></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>
    
    ```xaml
                    <TextBlock x:Uid="TextBlock_1" Text="{Binding ElementName=_myStartIMButton, 
                        Path=DisplayName}"/>
    ```

5.  Add a WindowsFormsHost control to the grid in the second row, second column.
    
    ```xaml
                <WindowsFormsHost 
                    x:Uid="_windowsFormsHost" 
                    x:Name="_windowsFormsHost" 
                    Grid.Row="1" 
                    Grid.Column="1"
    
                    VerticalAlignment="Stretch" 
                    HorizontalAlignment="Stretch" Margin="0,5,0,45" Grid.RowSpan="2">
    
                </WindowsFormsHost>
    ```

6.  Add a panel to the WindowsFormsHost control.
    
    This panel provides the scrolling feature of the sample.
    
    ```xaml
                            <wf:Panel 
                                x:Uid="_scrollViewer"
                                x:Name="_scrollViewer"
                                AutoScroll="True"
    Visible="False" />
    ```

The WPF window that is declared in this sample contains a multi-row, column grid that structures the controls in the window. Other controls include a stack panel to align a StartInstantMessagingButton control and string, a WindowsFormsHost control to accept a docked Lync 2013 conversation window, and a set of nested panels that allow the window to contain the conversation window regardless of its dimensions. The following figure shows two dialog boxes. The dialog box on the left is the WPF window that is declared in this sample. The dialog box on the right is a Lync 2013 conversation window that is not docked.

  
![Side by side view of a docked conversation window](images/JJ933086.LyncClientSDK_ConversationWindowDocking(Office.15).jpg "Side by side view of a docked conversation window")

## Initialize the hosting window

This procedure constructs the conversation manager wrapper class and registers for conversation-related events on the active conversation window.

### To register for events

1.  Register for the **FrameworkElement.Loaded** and **FrameworkElement.Unloaded** events.
    
    ```csharp
                Loaded += HandleLoaded;
                Unloaded += HandleUnloaded;
    ```

2.  Construct the view model class that encapsulates the [Microsoft.Lync.Model.Conversation.ConversationManager](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/jj266018\(v=office.15\)) and [Microsoft.Lync.Model.Conversation.Conversation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/jj276988\(v=office.15\)) objects.
    
    ```csharp
                _dockingConversationVm = new DockingConversationViewModel();
    ```

3.  Register for events on the [Microsoft.Lync.Model.Conversation.ConversationManager](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/jj266018\(v=office.15\)) object.
    
    The following example is taken from the sample Conversation manager model class and runs in the constructor that is called in the previous step.
    
    ```csharp
                //Subscribe to the Lync ConversationManager's ConversationAdded and ConversationRemoved events
                _lync.ConversationManager.ConversationAdded += ConversationManager_ConversationAdded;
                _lync.ConversationManager.ConversationRemoved += ConversationManager_ConversationRemoved;
    ```

4.  Create the helper WindowFlash class that flashes the WPF window when the conversation window needs attention.
    
    ```csharp
                _windowFlash = new WindowFlash(this, false);
                
    ```

5.  Register for the **Activated** event on the window so that you're notified that the window has the focus and flashing can stop.
    
    ```csharp
    Activated += MainWindowActivated;
    ```

## Handle the window loaded event

When the window is loaded, a panel is created to nest in the scrollable panel that we declared in the XAML and then the handle to the new panel to the **StartInstantMessagingButton** is provided so that when a conversation window is opened, it's automatically docked inside the panel.

### To handle the window loaded event

1.  Create a method whose signature matches the callback event signature of the **FrameworkElement.Loaded** event.
    
    ``` 
            /// <summary>
            /// This method handles the Main Window Loaded Event. It gets fired when the window is loaded.
            /// </summary>
            void HandleLoaded(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
            {
            }
    ```

2.  Create a new panel control in the event handler.
    
    ```csharp
                // Create the host for the conversation window.
                _conversationWindowParentPanel = new Panel();
    ```

3.  Add the new panel to the scroll viewing panel.
    
    ```csharp
                _scrollViewer.Controls.Add(_conversationWindowParentPanel);
    ```

4.  Get the handle to the new panel and set it as context for all new conversations created by the **StartInstantMessagingButton**.
    
    When the [ConversationContextualInfo.ParentWindowHandle](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh379561\(v=office.15\)) property is set on the control, any conversation started by clicking the control is docked in the container control whose handle is set as context.
    
    ``` 
                // Get the handle of the panel where we'll dock the conversation:
                IntPtr handle = _conversationWindowParentPanel.Handle;
    
                // Tell the StartInstantMessagingButton to dock the conversation into the panel we created above:
                _myStartIMButton.ContextualInformation = new ConversationContextualInfo{ParentWindowHandle = handle};
    ```

5.  Set the **StartInstantMessagingButtonSource()** property to the SIP address of a Lync user.
    
    When the button is clicked by the user, a conversation with the user specified by the address is started.
    
    ```csharp
                //Set the source of the IM button to a SIP address
                _myStartIMButton.Source = "dani@contoso.com";
    ```

6.  Register for the **FrameworkElement.SizeChanged** event so that there is a response when a user changes the size of the WPF window.
    
    ```csharp
                // Subscribe to the MainWindow.SizeChanged event so we can redock the conversation when layout changes happen.
                SizeChanged += HandleWindowSizeChanged;
    ```

## Dock a new conversation window

When a user clicks the **StartInstantMessagingButton** button, Lync 2013 opens a new conversation window and the [ConversationManager.ConversationAdded](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/jj266470\(v=office.15\)) event is raised. The handle to the docking panel was added as context on the **StartInstantMessagingButton** when the new panel was created. When this context is set, any conversation window that is opened by the button is automatically docked in the container control.

The sample uses this event to obtain an [Microsoft.Lync.Model.Extensibility.ConversationWindow](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/jj293606\(v=office.15\)) object that represents the new conversation window by calling the [Automation.GetConversationWindow](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/jj267667\(v=office.15\)) method. To respond to size change or attention events, the sample registers for the two events described in Resize the docking control when conversation window size changes.

```csharp
        /// <summary>
        /// This event is fired when the Conversation is created.  We use the automation
        /// API to get the ConversationWindow for the Conversation, and subscribe to important window events.â
        /// </summary>
        void ConversationManager_ConversationAdded(object sender, ConversationManagerEventArgs e)
        {
            if (ConversationAddedEvent != null)
            {
                _conversation = e.Conversation;
                try
                {
                    Automation automation = LyncClient.GetAutomation();
                    _conversationWindow = automation.GetConversationWindow(_conversation);
                }
                catch (LyncClientException lyncClientException)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine(lyncClientException);
                }

                if (_conversationWindow != null)
                {
                    //Subscribe to ConversationWindows's NeedsAttention and NeedsSizeChanged events
                    _conversationWindow.NeedsAttention += HandleNeedsAttention;
                    _conversationWindow.NeedsSizeChange += HandleNeedsSizeChange;
                    ConversationAddedEvent(this, null);
                }
            }
        }
```

## Resize the docking control when conversation window size changes

The **Conversation** window object is encapsulated by the Conversation manager model class and raises the two events as follows:

  - Conversation window size changed

  - Conversation window needs attention

### Handle the conversation window size changed event

A conversation window size change occurs when a visual element is added to the conversation window. For example, a user adds video to the conversation and a video window control is opened in the conversation window.

The sample application uses a pair of nested panel controls to contain the conversation window. The outer panel implements scroll bars so that if the inner panel is resized beyond the design time dimensions, scroll bars are shown on the outer panel. This allows the WPF window dimensions to remain fixed without regard to the dimensions of the docked conversation window.

If the dimensions of the scrolling panel are larger than the minimum dimensions of the conversation window, this event handler sets the dimensions of the docking panel to those of the scrolling panel. This logic is complex because of one or both scroll bars on the scrolling panel. Scroll bars reduce the display area of the panel and the logic must calculate the size of the scrolling panel with scroll bars and determine whether these dimensions are larger than the minimum size of the conversation window. If they are not, the docking panel dimensions are set to the minimum dimensions of the conversation window and scroll bars are displayed. Finally, the conversation window is redocked in the docking panel and resized to the dimensions of the docking panel.

<tr class="odd">
<td><p>You must respond to this event within 5 seconds by resizing the docking panel to fit the new dimensions of the conversation window. Failure to resize the docking panel causes the conversation window to undock.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### To handle the conversation window size changed event

1.  Get the new minimum dimensions of the conversation window.
    
    The following example handles the **ConversationWindowNeedsSizeChangedEvent** exposed by the helper Conversation manager model class. The helper class handles the [ConversationWindow.NeedsSizeChange](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/jj277925\(v=office.15\)) event. The example reads the **MinSize** property on the helper class that returns a **Size** object for the new minimum size of the conversation window.
    
    ```csharp
                int minWidth = _dockingConversationVm.MinSize.Width;
                int minHeight = _dockingConversationVm.MinSize.Height;
    ```

2.  Get the display area dimensions of the scrolling panel, excluding the width of horizontal and vertical scroll bars.
    
    ```csharp
                int availWidthWithScrollbar = _scrollViewer.Size.Width - SystemInformation.VerticalScrollBarWidth;
                int availableHeightWithScrollbar = _scrollViewer.Size.Height - SystemInformation.HorizontalScrollBarHeight;
    ```

3.  Determine whether setting the docking panel to the new minimum size of the conversation window requires the parent scrolling panel scroll bars to display.
    
    Displaying the scroll bar for one dimension shortens the other display dimension. For this reason, the new dimensions of the docking panel must be adapted to the display area of the scrolling panel with one or both scroll bars visible.
    
    ```csharp
                bool NeedsHorizontalScrollbars = _scrollViewer.Size.Width < minWidth;
                bool NeedsVerticalScrollbars = _scrollViewer.Size.Height < minHeight;
    
                if (NeedsHorizontalScrollbars ^ NeedsVerticalScrollbars)
                {
                    // If only one scrollbar is visible, check to see whether or not the addition
                    // of this scrollbar forces the other scrollbar to become visible...
                    if (NeedsVerticalScrollbars)
                    {
                        NeedsHorizontalScrollbars = availWidthWithScrollbar < minWidth;
                    }
                    else
                    {
                        NeedsVerticalScrollbars = availableHeightWithScrollbar < minHeight;
                    }
                }
    ```

4.  Set the dimensions of the docking panel to the larger of the minimum conversation window dimensions or the scrolling panel dimensions.
    
    ```csharp
                int width = NeedsHorizontalScrollbars
                    ? minWidth : (NeedsVerticalScrollbars ? availWidthWithScrollbar : _scrollViewer.Size.Width);
                int height = NeedsVerticalScrollbars
                    ? minHeight : (NeedsHorizontalScrollbars ? availableHeightWithScrollbar : _scrollViewer.Size.Height);
    
                //the panel is the actual container control and must be re-sized when the conversation window size changes
                //or the user resizes the scrollviewer.
                _conversationWindowParentPanel.Size = new Size(width, height);
                _conversationWindowParentPanel.Invoke(
                     (Action<IntPtr>)_dockingConversationVm.RedockConversation,
                    _conversationWindowParentPanel.Handle);
    ```

5.  Redock the conversation window in the resized docking panel.
    
    The following example docks the conversation window by calling the **RedockConversation** method from the model view class by calling the [ConversationWindow.Dock](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/jj294013\(v=office.15\)) method.
    
    ```csharp
            /// <summary>
            /// This method redocks the conversation window. When the docked conversation window adds a new visual
            /// element(such as video, a participant list, desktop sharing e.t.c) it's size changes. To accommodate
            /// this new element the conversation window will increase/decrease it's size accordingly. During this
            /// process we'll have to redock the newly changed window into the parent window. panelHandle is the
            /// Handle property of the parent window where docking will occur.
            /// </summary>
            public void RedockConversation(IntPtr panelHandle)
            {
                if (_conversationWindow == null)
                {
                    return;
                }
                try
                {
                    _conversationWindow.Dock(panelHandle);
                }
                catch (LyncClientException lyncClientException)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine(lyncClientException);
                }
            }
    ```

### Handle the conversation window needs attention event

If the application window does not have focus when the docked conversation window needs attention because of an event like a new IM message is received, then the application window should flash to get a userâs attention.

The sample makes a call into a method exposed by the unmanaged user32.dll. **FlashWindow** takes the handle of the window to flash and a Boolean value that indicates whether to flash. The call is made on a timer that ticks every half second. To see how the sample flashes the WPF window, see the WindowFlash class section.

## Code examples: Docking the conversation window sample

The sample application from which the previous code examples are taken is provide in this section. This is a WPF application that is built on the view, view model, model (MVVM) design. The sample contains an XAML declaration file, a C\# code-behind file that sets properties on elements declared in the XAML file, and a C\# file that encapsulates the conversation manager and handles events raised by the conversation manager and conversation window. Where appropriate, the class exposes event delegates to the view model logic.

### XAML declaration

The following example declares a window that will contain a docked conversation window.

```xaml
    
<Window x:Uid="Window_1" x:Class="DockingConversationWindowSample.MainWindow"
        xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
