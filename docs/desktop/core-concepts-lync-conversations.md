## Conversation overview

The Lync platform provides a conversation manager class that combines the features of conversation factory class with a view of the collection of conversations that are active on the platform at any time. The conversation manager exposes events that inform you when the local user is invited to a conversation and lets you respond by accepting or declining such invitations.

A Lync conversation is encapsulated by a conversation class. This conversation class has properties, methods, and events that give you great control over the conversation. Use the methods to do such things as invite additional people to the conversation, remove people from the conversation, add audio or video to an ongoing IM conversation, start resource sharing (desktop, program, or display), or even manage the content sharing stage of the conversation.

These modes of conversation, from IM through content sharing, are encapsulated by a set of conversation modality classes. All of these modality classes inherit a common modality parent, but have unique properties, methods, and events that are suited for the specific demands of the modality they encapsulate. Use the modality classes to control the flow of modality-specific information through a conversation. You can hold, forward, and transfer audio conversations just like you would on a PBX. These actions are performed on a conversation’s audio/video modality.
