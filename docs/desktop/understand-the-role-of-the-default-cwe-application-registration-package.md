# Understand the role of the default CWE application registration package

![Beyond the basics topic](images/JJ937254.mod_icon_beyondbasics_long(Office.15).png "Beyond the basics topic")

Use the default CWE application registration package in custom Lync 2013 automation applications to specify an extensibility tab application on the receiver side of a conversation.



**Applies to**: Lync 2013Â | Lync Server 2013

## Where to use a default package

If an incoming conversation has no context, you can specify a default package that starts when the conversation is accepted. For example, you might want to start a customer relationship management application with every incoming call, as in the following scenario.

John receives a telephone call on Lync 2013 from an important customer. When he answers, the most important data about the customer appears in his conversation window, including that his company just opened a high-priority support case. He answers the customer by name and immediately acknowledges the issue.

## Specify a default package

You must use Install Registration to register context packages on a computer. To use a context package, register it with Lync 2013. For more information about installing and registering packages, see [Register contextual conversation packages](register-contextual-conversation-packages.md). Although multiple context packages can be installed on a computer, there is only one default package. To specify that a context package is the default, set the **DefaultContextPackage** registry key to 1.

## Understand when a default package starts

On the sender side, the default CWE application starts when the conversation window opens. On the receiving side, if a default context package is registered on the receiving computer, it starts. If another CWE application ID is specified by the sending computer and a matching application ID is found on the local computer, both CWE applications start.
