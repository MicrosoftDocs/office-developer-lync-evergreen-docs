## Lync client compatibility

Microsoft Lync 2013 client supports all applications that reference the Lync 2013 API or any previous version of the Lync client API. However, older versions of the Lync client do not support applications built with later versions of the Lync API. In this case, attempting to get the API entry point by calling the static [LyncClient.GetClient](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/jj278213\(v=office.15\)) or [LyncClient.GetAutomation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/jj266970\(v=office.15\)) method fails with the [Microsoft.Lync.Model.ClientNotFoundException](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/jj293274\(v=office.15\)) exception. If multiple versions of the Lync client are installed on a computer, be sure to start the highest version of the client before starting your application.

### UI suppression

If multiple versions of the Lync client are installed on a computer, the most recent version of the client process starts when your application initializes the process by calling the [LyncClient.GetClient](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/jj278213\(v=office.15\)) method. If the starting process is not configured for UI suppression, the client UI is shown on the desktop. To avoid this, be sure to set UI suppression for all version of the client that you install on a computer.
