## Core SDK tasks

The [Microsoft.Lync.Model.LyncClient](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/jj274980\(v=office.15\)) class represents the SIP endpoint that can accept a set of user credentials and sign in to Microsoft Lync Server 2013. In addition, **LyncClient** can publish the signed-in user’s presence. Finally, **LyncClient** is the entry point for all further API functionality except for conversation automation. You access additional Lync 2013 API features by getting specialized feature manager class objects from properties of **LyncClient**. For example, you get a specialized contact manager by reading the [Client.ContactManager](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/jj275688\(v=office.15\)) property to get the [Microsoft.Lync.Model.ContactManager](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/jj266459\(v=office.15\)) object.
