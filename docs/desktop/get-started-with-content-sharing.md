## What is content sharing?

Content sharing in a conversation or meeting involves making a common whiteboard available for all conversation participants to annotate or control. PowerPoint slide decks can also be shared on the common content sharing stage of a Lync 2013 conversation window. To enable offline collaboration, native files such as Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, or text files can be uploaded to and downloaded from the conversation content sharing stage.

## Get started with content sharing

After reviewing the topics in the following sections, you will have enough information to implement the following content sharing features in your application:

  - Upload whiteboards and save annotations at the conclusion of a conversation.

  - Upload PowerPoint slide decks, scroll through slides, and then download slide decks presented by other users in the conversation.

  - Upload native files to the conversation sharing stage as attachments and then download the attachments.
