## Advanced content sharing programming

Your application must react to changes in the state of the content sharing modality and active shared content item to make your application UI responsive. For example, the UI of your application should have buttons to let a user take such actions as:

  - Add or remove an item from the meeting content bin.

  - Move an item to the sharing stage.

  - Clear or save annotations.

  - Take over as content presenter.

  - Download a meeting attachment.

These content-related actions can be unavailable, depending on the state of the content. As that state changes and the actions become available, your UI must be updated to give a user a hint that the actions can be performed.

As shareable content items are uploaded to a conversation or removed from a conversation, your UI should be updated to reflect the current collection of sharable content items. The content sharing modality for the conversation provides events that let you react to these changes.
