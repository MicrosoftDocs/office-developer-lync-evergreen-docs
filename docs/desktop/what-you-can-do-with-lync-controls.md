## What can you do with Lync Controls?

By dragging and dropping a Lync Control such as a PresenceIndicator onto a XAML page and setting the controlâ€™s **Source** property to a SIP address of a Lync user, you add the ability to see the presence state of any user whose SIP address is known. Just as easily, you can drag a StartAudioCallButton control on your page and set the **Source** property and give your page the ability to start an audio conversation with a Lync user in one click of the mouse.

By using a combination of Lync Controls, you can reproduce most of the features of the Lync 2013 client in your XAML page.
