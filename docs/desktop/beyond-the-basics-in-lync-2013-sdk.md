## Advanced API features

These advanced features are designed to give you programmatic access to some of the options that a Lync user can access through the **Lync options** menu on the client. If you are building an application that replaces the UI of a UI-suppressed Lync 2013 client and you want to provide a user with configuration options, then the topics in this section will get you started.

UI suppression is a feature that starts the Lync.exe process programmatically from your application and suppresses the entire user interface of the Lync 2013 client. This means that a user can only access Lync contacts, change configuration settings, start and accept conversations, and participate in conversations through your application.

Sign-in configuration means giving a user the ability to set connection settings. Settings include selecting automatic configuration or manual configuration, setting internal and external sign-in server names and IP addresses, and setting the connection protocol. These settings are also found in the **Lync options, Personal, Advanced Connection Settings** dialog box.

Conversation alert settings give a user the ability to control the circumstances when a conversation invitation alert dialog box open on the primary display. With these settings, the user can set the type and priority of conversation invitation that opens the invitation dialog box.
