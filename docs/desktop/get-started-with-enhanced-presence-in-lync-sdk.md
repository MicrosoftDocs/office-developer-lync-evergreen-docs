## What is enhanced presence?

Enhanced presence is a superset of the presence data format defined by RFC 3261, RFC 3265, and RFC 3863. Enhanced presence is a protocol for publishing and subscribing to presence data as well as a mechanism to authorize the access of a presence subscribing user to the presence of a publishing user.

Enhanced presence is organized into the state, calendar data, contact card, device, note, options, and call routing categories. These presence categories are exposed to the Lync 2013 API developer as class objects that encapsulate the SIP XML elements described in the presence protocol.

## Get started with enhanced presence

The prerequisites for working with enhanced presence are as follows:

  - Microsoft Lync 2013 must be installed and running on the development computer.

  - You must have sign-in credentials for Microsoft Lync Server 2013.

  - Microsoft Lync 2013 SDK must be installed on the development computer.
