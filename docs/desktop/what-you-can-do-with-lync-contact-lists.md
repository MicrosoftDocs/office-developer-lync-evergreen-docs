## Core contact list tasks

The topics in this section show how to programmatically update a user’s contact list or create a custom view of a contact list in an application.

The scope of programming that can be performed with the API types in this section ranges from calling methods in your code that change the contents of the content list in the Lync 2013 client, to building your own UI list and using the API to provide and update the UI list content. If you want to add a Lync 2013 contact list to your WPF or Silverlight window without writing any code, see [How to: Display a customized list of team contacts in Lync SDK](how-to-display-a-customized-list-of-team-contacts-in-lync-sdk.md).

Figure 1 shows a simple view of a contact list in a Windows Forms application. A user chooses a contact group from the drop-down list and then the contacts in that group are displayed in the list. Actual contact names are replaced by random strings for the purposes of this example.
