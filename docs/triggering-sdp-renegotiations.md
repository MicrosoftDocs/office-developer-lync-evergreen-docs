# Triggering SDP renegotiations


_**Applies to:** Lync 2013 | Lync Server 2013_

The [BeginSdpRenegotiation(CallDialogContext, AsyncCallback, Object)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh384458\(v=office.15\)) method on the **MediaProvider** instance can be used for several purposes, such as when an application places a call on hold or retrieves it, or when media types are added or removed. If an incoming SDP renegotiation is in progress when this method is called, the requested SDP renegotiation will begin after the pending renegotiation is finished. The **MediaProvider** instance should expect the [BeginGetOffer(OfferAnswerContext, Collection\<SdpContentDescription\>, AsyncCallback, Object)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh366051\(v=office.15\)) method on the **MediaProvider** instance to be called after **BeginSdpRenegotiation** has started.

After the call to **BeginSdpRenegotiation**, the call flow is similar to the call flow of an outgoing call with normal offer/answer. For more information, see [Negotiating declined offers](negotiating-declined-offers.md).
