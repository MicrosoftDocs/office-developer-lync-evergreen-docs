# Audio devices


_**Applies to:** Lync 2013 | Lync Server 2013_

The topics in this section describe the audio devices that are available in Microsoft Unified Communications Managed API 4.0: [Player](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh349780\(v=office.15\)), [Recorder](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh381624\(v=office.15\)), [ToneController](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh349643\(v=office.15\)), [SpeechRecognitionConnector](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh383253\(v=office.15\)), and [SpeechSynthesisConnector](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh349773\(v=office.15\)). These devices, respectively, can be used to play recorded audio, record audio, send and receive telephone dial tones, convert speech to text, or convert text to speech.

> <P>The <STRONG>SpeechRecognitionConnector</STRONG> and <STRONG>SpeechSynthesisConnector</STRONG> classes are designed to work exclusively with classes in the <STRONG>Microsoft.Speech</STRONG> namespace.</P>



In UCMA 4.0, devices are users of media data, and have [AudioVideoFlow](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh383533\(v=office.15\)) instances attached to them. Although these devices are represented as properties on the **AudioVideoFlow** class, they are not automatically instantiated and each device is independent of the **AudioVideoFlow** instance that is attached to it. Before any of these devices can be used, it must be created, and then attached to an **AudioVideoFlow** instance. Although most of the devices are associated with a single **AudioVideoFlow** instance, a **Player** device can have multiple **AudioVideoFlow** instances attached to it. In addition, an **AudioVideoFlow** instance can be detached from a given **Player**, and another **AudioVideoFlow** instance can be attached.

The following code example shows the steps required to create a **Player** and attach an existing **AudioVideoFlow** instance to it.

    Player myPlayer = new Player();
    myPlayer.AttachFlow(avFlow);

Each of the devices has an **AttachFlow** method that it uses to attach an **AudioVideoFlow** instance. Similarly, each device has a **DetachFlow** method that it uses to detach the previously-attached **AudioVideoFlow** instance. The **AttachFlow** and **DetachFlow** operations can happen at any time, independent of the state of the **AudioVideoFlow** instance.

Except for a **Player** device, a given **AudioVideoFlow** instance can be attached to only one device at a time. The **AudioVideoFlow** can remove the channel spontaneously if the Real-Time Protocol (RTP) connection is broken or if the far end requests a hold or renegotiation.

When a device is shut down, the attached **AudioVideoFlow** is not automatically detached. The **AudioVideoFlow** remains attached until it is detached. The **AudioVideoFlow** must eventually be detached, or a memory leak will result. A long-lived device such as a **Player** can have many flows attached to it, and each flow and all related objects remain in memory even when the **Player** is shut down.
