# How to: Debug a Lync Server SIP application

Learn how to debug a SIP application in a Microsoft Lync Server 2013 deployment.


**Applies to**: Lync Server 2013

To debug a SIP application that is loaded into a Lync Server 2013 deployment, trace the execution of the Microsoft SIP Processing Language (MSPL) script that is embedded in the application manifest in addition to the managed application components.

## Debugging MSPL script

MSPL supports tracing functionality through the built-in [Log](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh364642\(v=office.15\)) function that can be called throughout the script block to log run-time data in the Windows Event Viewer log on the server or the ApiLogger utility that is distributed with Microsoft Lync Server 2013 SDK. The following example shows the C\# syntax for the **Log** function.

```csharp
void Log(string name, bool detail, params string[] messages);
```

The name parameter specifies the name of the log. It can be "Event, Error, or Debugr. The first two correspond to the Windows Event Viewer log. Debugr is the application-specific ApiLogger debug utility. The messages parameters contain zero or more messages that appear in the specified log. For the "Event" log, the supplied messages are logged as a warning in Windows Event Viewer. For the "Error" log, the supplied messages appear as an error in Windows Event Viewer.

The level of detail for each message in the log is set with the second parameter. If it's false, only the "Method", "To", "From", and "Request-Uri" headers are logged, together with the date/time and the application URI. If it's true, the whole SIP message is logged.

## Using ApiLogger

By default, the ApiLogger.exe utility is installed in the %progfile%\\Microsoft Lync Server 2013\\SDK\\Bin directory. To run this utility, start the executable by double-clicking the ApiLogger.Exe file or issue the following command from a Command window.

``` 
 "c:\program files\Microsoft Lync Server 2013\SDK\Bin" ApiLogger.exe
```

The utility prompts you to restart the Lync Server Front End role. To do so, issue the following command from another Command window.

    Net stop rtcsrv
    Net start rtcsrv

You can also restart this service by using the Services utility. Right-click the **Lync Server Front-End** entry, and then selecting **Restart**.

When the RtcSrv service is restarted, ApiLogger is connected to the server and the debug messages from all the loaded MSPL scripts appear in the ApiLogger window.

The following table describes the ApiLogger error messages.
